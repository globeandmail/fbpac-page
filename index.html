			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>The Political Ad Collector is a tool you add to your Web browser. It copies the ads you see on Facebook, so anyone, on any part of the political spectrum, can see them in <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/">our public database</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>It doesn't collect your personal information</strong>. We take your privacy very seriously.</p>

				<div class="collect-text">
					<h3>What we collect</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Text and links in the ad</li>
						<li>The picture in the ad</li>

						<li>The time and date the ad was seen</li>

			<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
			<p>Online ads are usually seen only by the audience the advertiser wants to target, and then they disappear. This makes it difficult for the public to monitor them and hold advertisers, including political groups, accountable. This isn’t a partisan issue. We think it’s important for our democracy to check what politicians of all stripes are saying.</p>
			<p>Here are a few examples of what we’ve learned from the tool so far:</p>
			<h3>We’ve found deceptive ads</h3>
			<p>We saw <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-political-ads-malware-scams-misleading">scam political ads</a> that masked consumer rip-offs. Some contained malware. They preyed on people’s interest in partisan politics to trick them into clicking.</p>
			<h3>We’ve found politicians breaking FEC disclosure rules</h3>
			<p>Campaigns on both sides of the aisle were <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/i-approved-this-facebook-message-but-you-dont-know-that">failing to follow</a> a new ruling from the Federal Election Commission that they had to disclose who was paying for Facebook ads. Violators included Trump 2020 re-election campaign and the Democratic National Commission.</p>
			<h3>We’ve found misleading facts</h3>
			<p>During the Republican Senate primary in Alabama in 2016, a Republican super PAC opposed to candidate Roy Moore <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/ad/23842672388160612">ran an inaccurate ad</a> on Facebook. It claimed that Moore didn’t support President Trump about the wall on the Mexican border.</p>

			<p>The tool gives you the option to decide whether or not an ad is political. This helps train our ”artificial intelligence tool” so it can flag political ads.” If you want to tell us an ad is political, click “Political Ad.” If it’s not political, click “Normal Ad.” Sometimes ads aren’t clearly political, and that’s OK. Just choose what you think is best.</p>
			<p>If you want to check out political ads in the U.S., you can see the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/">public archive here</a>.</p>
			<p>And if you want to help the most? Please share our tool with your friends and family on Facebook! Here’s our <a href="">Facebook page</a> where we’ll keep you posted on what we learn.</p>
