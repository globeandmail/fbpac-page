			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>The Political Ad Collector is a tool you add to your Web browser. It copies the ads you see on Facebook, so anyone, on any part of the political spectrum, can see them.</p>
			<p><strong>We know you’re probably worried about downloading software that can see things on your Facebook feed</strong>. We understand, and we want to assure you that we aren’t collecting your personal information. We delete details like Facebook ID numbers and data about who has liked and shared a post. We don’t record who sees what ad.</p>

				</div> <!-- end .collect-image -->
				<div class="collect-text">
					<h3>What we collect</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Text and links in the ad</li>
						<li>The picture in the ad</li>
						<li>Information Facebook provides about the ad’s target audience</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>Other information:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>The time and date the ad was seen</li>
						<li>The number of times the ad has been seen</li>
						<li>The ad’s language of origin</li>

			<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
			<p>Online, ads are usually seen only by the audience the advertiser wants to target, and then they disappear. This makes it difficult for the public to check them and hold advertisers, including political groups, accountable. This isn’t a partisan issue. As journalists, we think it’s important for our democracy to check what politicians of all stripes are saying.</p>
			<p>Here are a few examples of what we’ve learned from the tool so far:</p>
			<h3>We’ve found deceptive ads</h3>
			<p>We saw scam political ads that actually masked consumer rip-offs. Some contained malware. They preyed on people’s interest in partisan politics to trick them into clicking.</p>
			<h3>We’ve found politicians breaking FEC disclosure rules</h3>
			<p>Many ads both parties were failing to follow a new ruling from the Federal Election Commission saying they had to disclose who was paying for the ad. These included examples from Trump 2020 and the Democratic National Commission.</p>
			<h3>We’ve found misleading facts</h3>
			<p>During the Republican Senate primary in Alabama in 2016, a Republican super PAC ran an ad saying candidate Roy Moore didn’t support President Trump about the wall on the Mexican border.</p>

			<h2>Want to do more?</h2>
			<p>If you want to tell us an ad is political, click “Political Ad.” If it’s not political, click “Normal Ad.” Sometimes ads aren’t clearly political, and that’s OK. Just choose what you think is best.</p>
			<p>Next to the ads from your Facebook feed, you’ll also see ads that other people are seeing. You can vote whether those are political or not political too. This voting helps train our “artificial intelligence” tool so it can flag political ads.</p>
			<p>If you want to check out political ads in the U.S., you can see the public archive here.</p>
			<p>And if you want to help the most? Please share our tool with your friends and family on Facebook! Here’s our Facebook page where we’ll keep you posted on what we learn.</p>
