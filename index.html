			<h2>How it works</h2>
			<p>The Political Ad Collector is a tool you add to your Web browser. It copies the ads you see on Facebook, so anyone, on any part of the political spectrum, can see them.</p>
			<p><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t collect your personal information</strong>. We take your privacy very seriously.</p>

					<img src="assets/images/helpful-example.jpg" alt="An image detailing what we do and don't collect">
				</div>
				<div class="collect-text">
					<h3>What we collect</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Text and links in the ad</li>
						<li>The picture in the ad</li>
						<li>Information Facebook provides about the ad&rsquo;s target audience</li>
					</ol>
					<ul>
						<li>The time and date the ad was seen</li>
						<li>The number of times the ad has been seen</li>
						<li>The ad&rsquo;s language of origin</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>What we <u>don&rsquo;t</u> collect</h3>
					<p><strong>Anything else, including:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your Facebook ID number</li>				<li>Who has liked and shared a post</li>

			<h2>Why it matters</h2>
			<p>Online ads are usually seen only by the audience the advertiser wants to target, and then they disappear. This makes it difficult for the public to monitor them and hold advertisers, including political groups, accountable. This isn&rsquo;t a partisan issue. We think it&rsquo;s important for our democracy to check what politicians of all stripes are saying. In the past, news organizations using this tool have found <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-political-ads-malware-scams-misleading">deceptive ads</a> and political groups making <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/facebook-ads/ad/23842672388160612">misleading claims</a>).</p>

			<p>The tool gives you the option to decide whether or not an ad is political. This helps train our &ldquo;artificial intelligence tool&rdquo; so it can flag political ads. If you want to tell us an ad is political, click &ldquo;Political Ad.&rdquo; If it&rsquo;s not political, click &ldquo;Normal Ad.&rdquo; Sometimes ads aren&rsquo;t clearly political, and that&rsquo;s OK. Just choose what you think is best.</p>
