# fbpac-page

This is an explanatory webpage for the [Facebook Political Ad Collector](https://github.com/globeandmail/facebook-political-ads/). For a full breakdown of the other services you'll need to deploy the app, see the [README for our main repo](https://github.com/globeandmail/facebook-political-ads/blob/master/README.md).

It's meant to be seen by readers who want to learn about the extension, what it does (and doesn't) collect, etc.


### Installation

Nothing to install or build. It's a webpage, ready to host.

### Deployment

Find a host and put it on there. Alternatively, deploy this to GitHub Pages.
